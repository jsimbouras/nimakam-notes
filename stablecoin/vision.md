# Vision

**Decentralized digital money for the masses.**

A **widely available**, **dependable** and **easy-to-use** **digital currency**, that consumers can buy, use, hold and **collect interest** on, without the involvement of banks.

## Business goals

- **Digital money for the masses** - Provide everyday people with a usable (requiring minimal cognitive load) and competitive (interest bearing) digital stablecoin based on blockchain technology.
- **Wide availability** - A currency cannot be easy-to-use if it is not widely accepted by a network of people and businesses, and it is not widely accepted if doesn't grow past a tipping point, where mainstream financial ecosystem players are incentivized to support it.
- **Maximal decentralization** - Eliminate risk of rent-seeking through capture, and minimize the need for third-party trust, with goals of improving conditions of adoption by other businesses, and significantly reducing risk of central failure.
- **Incentivization** - Provide loan takers with sufficient incentives to take loans (open debt positions using collateral), competitively compared to other market solutions. Provide different stakeholders with a competitive but profitable business model that incentivizes and guides them into behavior that benefits the system and other stakeholders.
- **Simplicity** - Minimize operational complexity, such that it is relatively easy for all stakeholders to anticipate the system's automated behavior, and predict future outcomes.
- **Capital efficiency** - Making the flow of capital more efficient through the system unlocks economic value and benefits all stakeholders.

## Long term trend assumptions

- **Disruption of finance** - Financial assets and processes would increasingly be digitized and decentralized, through use of blockchain technology, due to the significant efficiency unlocked in building and operating financial systems.
- **Collateral-backed stablecoins** - Using smart contracts to offer a stable-value token by collateralizing other digital assets, is the optimal method for creating decentralized blockchain-based stablecoins.

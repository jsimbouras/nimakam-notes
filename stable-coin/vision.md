# Vision

**Decentralized digital money for the masses.**

A widely available, dependable and easy-to-use digital currency, that people can buy, use, hold and collect interest on, without the constraints of banks.

## Goals

- **Digital money for the masses** - Provide everyday people with a usable (requiring minimal cognitive load) and competitive (interest bearing) digital stable-coin based on blockchain technology.
- **Wide availability** - A currency cannot be easy-to-use if it is not widely accepted by a network of people and businesses, and it is not widely accepted if doesn't grow past a tipping point, where mainstream financial ecosystem players are incentivized to support it.
- **Maximal decentralization** - Eliminate risk of capture and minimize need for centralized trust in order to increase chance of adoption, and to significantly reduce risk of failure.
- **Incentivization** - Provide loan takers with sufficient incentives to get loans (open debt positions with collateral), competitively compared to other market solutions. Provide system maintainers with a competitive but profitable business model that incentivizes and guides them into constructive behavior.
- **Simplicity** - Minimize operational complexity, such that it is relatively simple for all stakeholders to predict the system's automated behavior.

## Implicit assumptions

- **Blockchain technology disrupting finance** - Progressive digitization and decentralization of financial assets and processes through use of blockchain technology will increase the efficiency of building and operating financial systems by orders of magnitude.
- **Collateral-backed stable-coins** - Best known (state of the art) method for creating a blockchain stable coin is through using digital assets as collateral on a smart contract.

# Trust-minimal stable-coin research proposal

This research proposal envisions and describes a viable system that offers a widely available, dependable and easy-to-use digital currency, that people can buy, use, hold and collect interest on, without the constraints of banks. The proposed implementation would operate on a public blockchain and would be backed by its most trust-minimized digital asset. The system is meant to by fully decentralized, and operate on-chain without any need for a specific operator.
